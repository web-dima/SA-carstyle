This plugin allows you to quickly insert icons selectable Font Awesome preview from the additional buttons in the tinymce bar

== Description ==

With this plugin you can insert icons Font Awesome inside your post. 
Simply select the desired icon and will be automatically entered in the shortcode that will allow you 
to customize the icon and select the size, color, and if the icon should be fixed.


The characteristics of the plugin are:

*   This includes more than 400 icons
*   No need to modify your templates to include the icons, but just select and insert them into your post
*   The icons are divided into the following groups: 
	New Icons in 4.0, Web Application Icons, Forms Control Icons, Currency Icons, Text Editor Icons, 
	Icons Directional, Video palyer Icons, Brand Icons, Medical Icons


    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
